# Euclidean Rhythm Generator

A Rust implementation that generates musical rhythm patterns using the Euclidean algorithm, originally developed by the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid.

## Overview

Euclidean rhythms are generated by an algorithm that distributes a given number of pulses as evenly as possible across a specified number of steps. Research has shown that many traditional musical rhythms from around the world coincide with patterns generated by this algorithm.

## Core Features

- `euclidean_rhythm(pulses: usize, steps: usize) -> Vec<bool>`: Generates a Euclidean rhythm
- `rotate_rhythm(rhythm: &[bool], rotation: usize) -> Vec<bool>`: Rotates a rhythm pattern
- `rhythm_to_string(rhythm: &[bool]) -> String`: Converts a rhythm pattern to a visual string representation

## Example Rhythm Patterns

- Cuban tresillo (E(3,8)) = [x..x..x.]
- Cuban cinquillo (E(5,8)) = [x.xx.xx.]
- Bossa-nova (E(5,16)) = [x..x..x..x..x....]
- Brazilian Samba (E(7,16)) = [x..x.x.x..x.x.x.]

## Usage Example

```rust
let rhythm = euclidean_rhythm(3, 8);  // Cuban tresillo
println!("E(3, 8) = [{}]", rhythm_to_string(&rhythm));
// Output: E(3, 8) = [x..x..x.]
```

## Note
- 'x' represents an onset (beat)
- '.' represents a rest
- Each rhythm pattern can be rotated to create variations that are also found in traditional music
